# ogu-data-processing

## Overview

These are Python tools developed by the Organic Geochemistry Unit to help
with data processing. They are likely to be largely concerned with
compound-specific IRMS.

The IRMS data must first be prepared into `.csv` files using the
`isoreader` R package. No similar package for loading IRMS binary files
yet exists in Python.
